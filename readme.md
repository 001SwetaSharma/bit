# bit - the usable code component manager
Today, finding small code components means searching the web (e.g. googling stack overflow...) and copy-pasting them across multiple repositories.
We all do it, and we all know it's bad: it creates an unmaintainable, hard to update code base with an ever growing technological debt.

The alternative, treating few lines of code as entire packages, means creating a heavy dependency tree while relying on external sources. 
We all remember the left pad story. We also know that a bigger dependency tree equals a slower build and a heavier app.

Bit's code component manager saves the need to copy-paste code components or to install entire packages for a few lines of code. 
Each code component can be easily published, found or injected into your code in seconds and without effort.

A simple code component like this: 
```js
  function padLeft (str, len, ch) {
    str = String(str);
    var i = -1;
    if (!ch && ch !== 0) ch = ' ';
    len = len - str.length;
    while (++i < len) {
      str = ch + str;
    }
    return str;
  }
  
  module.exports = padLeft;
```

Simply becomes:
```js
  bit.padLeft(str, len, ch);
```
It allows you to design lighter applications with super fast installation and a duplication-free and easy-to-maintain code base which does not depend on external sources.

## installation (future)
```bash
  brew install bit
```

## development
install dependencies using yarn (npm would work too).
```bash
  $ yarn
```

install command globally and link
```bash
  npm install -g
  npm link
```

build legacy and modern distributions:
```bash
  npm run build
```
